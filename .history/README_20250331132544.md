# 🎨 Experiment Automation with Plotting Libraries 🚀

## Overview
This script automates experiments to benchmark various Python plotting libraries. It integrates with the EnergiBridge system to measure energy consumption and logs the results. The script iterates through multiple experiments, shuffling the order of plotting libraries, and generating different plot types while collecting performance metrics. 📊⚡

## Features
- Supports multiple plotting libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.). 🎨
- Generates line, bar, scatter, box, and heatmap plots from predefined datasets. 📈
- Uses EnergiBridgeManager to measure energy consumption for each test run. 🔋
- Saves generated plots to an output directory (optional). 💾
- Logs all experiment details to `log.txt`. 📝
- Implements a pause period between experiment iterations to ensure consistent measurement. ⏳

## Requirements
- Python 3.x 🐍
- Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration ⚙️
- Adjust the number of experiments in the `num_experiments` variable. 🔄
- Set `save_plots = True` to save the generated plots. 🖼️
- Modify `output_dir` to specify where plots should be stored. 📂

### Output 📡
- Plots (if enabled) are saved in the `output_plots` directory, organized by plot type. 🗂️
- Energy consumption data is logged in CSV files. 📊
- Execution logs are recorded in `log.txt`. 📝

## File Structure 📂
- `BasePlotter.py`: Defines the base plotting interface. 🎭
- `energibridge_manager.py`: Handles energy consumption measurement. ⚡
- `plot_factory.py`: Manages the creation of different plotting library instances. 🏭
- `data.py`: Generates synthetic datasets for the experiments. 🔢
- `main.py`: Entry point that runs the experiments. ▶️
